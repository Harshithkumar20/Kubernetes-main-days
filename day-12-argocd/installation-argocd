#Create the namespace for argoCD

kubectl create namespace argocd
#Install ArgoCD using the below command

kubectl apply -n argocd -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/stable/manifests/install.yaml

#After installing the ArgoCD, you can run the below command to check what resources it has created.

kubectl get all -n argocd

# Now in order to access the UI of ArgoCD, you need to run the below command
kubectl edit svc argocd-server -n argocd  #enable Node Port 


kubectl get svc -n argocd

#Now, in order to log into the UI you need the credentials. So, for a username, you can write admin and the password is stored in the secret called argocd-initial-admin-secret in the cluster.
You need to run the below command to get the value of the secret.

kubectl get secret argocd-initial-admin-secret -n argocd -o yaml

#The secret base64 encoded so, you have to decode the secret by running the below command.

echo "secret value" | base64 --decode


#After running the above command you can have the decoded value of the secret and using that as a password you can log in to the UI.
Now, the installation has been completed.
